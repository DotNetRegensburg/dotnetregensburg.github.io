title: Produce Cleaner Code with Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP)
speaker:
  name: Gael Fraiteur
  description: Gael has been passionately programming since childhood. He envisioned building aspect-oriented software that would offer .NET developers the same productivity benefits as those enjoyed by the Java community. Gael's vision became a reality when, in 2004, he built and released PostSharp to the wild. PostSharp has steadily grown to become the most comprehensive aspect-oriented software for .NET available today. Gael lives with his wife and 3 kids in Prague, Czech Republic.

Rather than giving us a nice separation of concerns (assembly > namespace > class > method), there are times when OOP forces us to write crap - scattering, tangling and coupling our code. 
                        
Gael Fraiteur, SharpCrafters Founder and Principal Engineer, will speak about the problem with conventional programming, give a gentle introduction to AOP, show how it works, and why you should be using it to eliminate crap code from your life.
